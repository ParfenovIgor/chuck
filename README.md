## Overview

The only screen contains swiping pages. Each page contains joke, which is downloaded from [chucknorris.io](https://api.chucknorris.io). At the bottom there are four buttons:

* Set *like* reaction to current joke and swipe to next one
* Set *dislike* reaction to current joke and swipe to next one
* Load current joke page in browser
* Copy current joke to clipboard

Previous jokes and reactions to jokes are stored in the current session. The pages are swipeable in both directions.
